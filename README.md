This project will show you how to build a custom styled Google map using the Google Cloud Platform and the Google Maps JavaScript API.

Check out the full project on DevProjects by Codementor.

## Instructions

The code here requires a Google Cloud Platform API key and a Google Maps custom Map ID in order to work.

The places that need updating are:

- Add the `API_KEY` and `MAP_ID` in the `<script>` tag for the Maps API in the `index.html` file
- Add in the `MAP_ID` in the `script.js` file
